# Arachni CLI Arg-String Generator
![](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2016.svg)

This tool is used to simplify the use of arachni from the command-line for those that don't use arachni enough to memorise the commands (or for those lazy like I am). 

# Retrieve script
Rather than cloning the git repo (pointless), just use:


```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ins1gn1a/arachni-cli-shortcut/master/arachni-cli.sh```
